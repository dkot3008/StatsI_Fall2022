	\begin{itemize}
		\item Please show your work! You may lose points by simply writing in the answer. If the problem requires you to execute commands in \texttt{R}, please include the code you used to get your answers. Please also include the \texttt{.R} file that contains your code. If you are not sure if work needs to be shown for a particular problem, please ask.
		\item Your homework should be submitted electronically on GitHub.
		\item This problem set is due before 23:59 on Sunday December 4, 2022. No late assignments will be accepted.

	\section*{Question 1}
	\vspace{.25cm}
	\noindent 	
	Define and describe why the following four (4) terms are important to hypothesis testing
	and/or regression. You can earn full credit with just two or three sentences, but please be
	specific and thorough.
	 
	 \newpage
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item [(a)]
		Residuals- Residuals can be used to determine if variables are related
		
		\vspace{1cm}
		\item [(b)]
		Categorical data- This a type of data that is representing a set of characteristics or traits,examples of this could be nationality or gender where there is a defined  amout of groups which you cna be assigned to. It has no order or rank.\\

		Dummy variables- These are when you use a categroical variable as a predictor in a regression to seperate a group to see if the effect varies within the groups characteristics. An example fo this could be that without rnak at a job considered better work leads to mre income but if a dummy variable is implemented it can show if this effect is true for managers and not managers adding insight to data.
		
		\vspace{1cm}
		\item [(c)]
		Test statistic- This is a statistic that sumarrises how much data is different from what would be expected to observe if the null hypothesis were true 
		\vspace{1cm}
		\item [(d)]
		Constituent term-This is at times also called "main effects" as in a multiple Regression are the variables which represent a portion of the effect.

	\section*{Question 2}
	\vspace{.25cm}
	\noindent 	Many of the wells used for drinking water in Bangladesh and other South Asian countries are contaminated with natural arsenic, affecting an estimated 100 million people. Arsenic is a cumulative poison, and exposure increases the risk of cancer and other diseases, with risks
	estimated to be proportional to exposure.\\
	We performed a regression analysis with the data to understand the factors that predict the arsenic level of 1000 households’ drinking water. Your outcome variable arsenic is a continuous measure of household i’s arsenic level in units of hundreds of micrograms per liter.\\
	We estimated models with the following inputs:\\
	• The distance (in kilometers/100) to the closest known commercial factory\\
	• Depth of respondent’s well (binary variable; deep=1, not deep=0)

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item [(a)] First, we successfully estimated an additive model with well depth and distance to
		the nearest factory as the two predictors of a household’s arsenic level. The estimated
		coefficients are found in the first column of the table above. Interpret the estimated
		coefficients for the intercept and each predictor.\\
		
		

		
		\item [(b)]  Does the coefficient estimate for the closest known factory vary based on whether or not
		a house has a deep well? If so, change your interpretation of the estimated coefficients
		in part (a) to conform with the interactive model in column 2 of the table above. What
		is the appropriate test to determine whether we should model the relationship between
		distance, well depth, and arsenic levels using an additive or interactive model? What
		information would you need to perform that test?
		
		
		
		\vspace{2cm}
		\item [(c)] Using the ‘preferred’ model from Part B, compute the average difference in arsenic
		levels between two households that have a deep well (=1), but one is closer to a factory
		(dist100 = 0.42) than the other (dist100 = 2.12).
